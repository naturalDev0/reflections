Lesson 1: Navigating a Commit History

Reflect: Using diff to Find Bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1:
- How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

The process has given me a lighter job in comparing two piles of codes with the
help of bash, instead of using by hands.

Question 2: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

- Easy management of amendments and being accountable to one's work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

- Pros
Git, able to create multiple commits that can be used to compared line by line.
Google Docs, periodically saved each amendments and that saves the user from accidentally
	forgetting to save their own works.

- Cons 
Git, individual commits evaluation.
Google Docs, individual commits evaluation.

Reflect: Mutli-File Commits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file spearately?

- It might be related to Database? or Rich-Text Format documents (.docx,etc)?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- Verifying and comparing different amendments of the codes before making any commits.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reflect: Confidence from Version Control 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 6: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

- It gives the privillege to check which commits that possess the fault, one by another
just to make sure you won't accidentally save the wrong ones for the main project.

Question 7: What do you want to try using Git for?

- VERSION CONTROL! and also not to forget to keep up with the times of technology advance-
ment.
